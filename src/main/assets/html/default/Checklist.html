Items are checked by touching the check box (or by a touch anywhere on the row, if enabled).
Check boxes can be placed on either side of the display.
<p>A long touch on an item lets you rename it or delete it.</p>
Unless sorting is enabled, a handle on each item <img src="../img/ic_action_move.svg">
lets you move the item to another position in the list.
Touch and hold to drag the item.
