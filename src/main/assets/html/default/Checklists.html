<h1>Lists</h1>
<p>Open a list by touching its name.</p>
<p>A long touch on the list name will bring up a context menu that lets you:
<ul>
    <li>Rename List</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
    <li>Create Copy</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Create copy will make an identical copy of the list. You can use this to create template list
    with e.g.
    the basic groceries that you always buy.</p>
