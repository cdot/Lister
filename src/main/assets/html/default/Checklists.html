<p>Open a list by touching its name.</p>
<p>A long touch on the list name will bring up a context menu that lets you:
<ul>
    <li>Rename List</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
    <li>Create Copy</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Create copy will make an identical copy of the list. You can use this to create template list
    with e.g.
    the basic groceries that you always buy.</p>
<p>Unless alphabetic sorting is on, a handle on each list <img src="../img/ic_action_move.svg">
lets you move the list to another position in the list of lists. Touch and hold to drag the list.</p>

            app is installed. It must
            be in JSON format previously exported, or in CSV format where the first column is the
            name of the item, and the second column a checked value ("false", "0", and ""
            are read as false. Any other value is read as true)
