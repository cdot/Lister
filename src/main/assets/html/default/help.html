<h1>Main Page</h1>
The main page contains a list of all the lists you have created.<br/>
<br/>
A list is opened by clicking the name of the list.<br/>
<br/>
A long click on the list name will bring up a context menu that lets you<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Rename List</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
    <li>Create Copy</li>
</ul>
Create copy will make an identical copy of the list. This lets you create template list with e.g. your base groceries that you always buy.<br/>

<h1>Settings</h1>
<strong>Dim checked items</strong><br/>
Lower contrast on checked items so it is easier to see the items that are left to do.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Strike through checked items</strong><br/>
Checked items gets crossed out with a line through them.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Move checked items to bottom</strong><br/>
The checked items are shown after the unchecked items. This only effects the view. The list is not really re-ordered.<br/>
Note: When this is enabled, moving items may not work as expected.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Left hand operation</strong><br/>
Default behavior is that the check box and move button is on the right side. This option moves them to the left side.<br/>
This allows both left and right handed people to manage the list items with one hand.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Auto-delete checked items</strong><br/>
Delete items automatically when they are checked. It is still possible to do un-delete as usual.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Entire row toggles check box</strong><br/>
To make it even easier to check items, this option allows the entire row to toggle the check box.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Add new items at top of list</strong><br/>
By default items are added at the bottom of the list.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Show list in front of lock screen</strong><br/>
If the screen is locked, this option lets you continue using the list without unlocking it.<br/>
Note: You still need to unlock the screen before you can access any other app.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Open latest list when app is started</strong><br/>
When the app is started it will automatically launch the last open list from the previous session, if it still exists.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Warning before adding duplicate item to list</strong><br/>
When a newly entered item has a similar item already in the list; this shows a popup asking for confirmation before the new item is added to the list.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Dark background</strong><br/>
When in a list view, this shows screen with white text on dark background. This saves battery on AMOLED displays.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Enable local dictionary</strong><br/>
When this is enabled, entered items are remembered and used as suggestions for new items.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Enable automatic backup</strong><br/>
When this is enabled, the list is automatically saved to external storage when you exit the list view.<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Text size</strong><br/>
Set the text size of the list items. Use the system default or manually set Small, Medium or Large<br/>
