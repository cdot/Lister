<h1>Main Page</h1>
<p>The main page contains a list of all the lists you have created.</p>
<p>A list is opened by clicking the name of the list.</p>
<p>A long click on the list name will bring up a context menu that lets you
<ul>
    <li>Rename List</li>
    <li>Delete</li>
    <li>Create Copy</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Create copy will make an identical copy of the list. This lets you create template list with e.g.
    your basic groceries that you always buy.</p>
