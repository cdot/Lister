# Mr Lister
Android app that provides checkable lists with storage via ContentResolver (lists can be on SDcard,
or Google Drive, or anything else that supports the Android Content Resolver interface)

Useful for shared shopping lists, and any other kind of checklist.

And yes, the name is a nod in the direction of Red Dwarf

# History
The app was inspired by the ["rList" application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rundgong.shoppinglist),
which I had been using for shopping lists. I wanted a slightly different data model, that allowed
me to store lists on Google Drive and share them across a number of different devices.

All the help you should need is available from inside the application - it's pretty simple!
