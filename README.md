# Mr Lister
Android app that provides checkable lists with storage via ContentResolver (lists can be on SDcard,
or Google Drive, or anything else that supports the Android Content Resolver interface)

Useful for shared shopping lists, and other kinds of checklist.

# History
The app was inspired by the ["rList" application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rundgong.shoppinglist),
which I had been using for shopping lists. I wanted a slightly different data model, that allowed
me to store lists on Google Drive and share them across a number of different devices. In addition,
there were a number of bugs in rList that I wanted to solve. The rList source code was not
available open source, so I built my own.
